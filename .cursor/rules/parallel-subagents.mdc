# Parallel Subagents for Multi-File Operations

When a task involves **auditing or editing 5+ independent files**, prefer parallel subagents over sequential tool calls. If changes have ordering dependencies, keep dependent steps sequential.

## When to parallelize

- **Audits**: searching for patterns, checking consistency, or reviewing code across 5+ files
- **Edits**: renaming, fixing stale references, or applying the same pattern across 5+ files
- **Mixed**: audit first (parallel), then edit (parallel) based on findings

## How to split work

Group files by **independence** — changes that don't depend on each other go in separate subagents. Max 4 concurrent subagents.

Good splits:

- By layer: Docker/infra files | source code | documentation | config
- By concern: backend changes | frontend changes

Bad splits:

- Putting a TSX file and its CSS file in different subagents (coordinated rename)
- Splitting a function definition from its callers

## Subagent instructions

Each subagent prompt must include:

1. The exact files to read/edit
2. The specific changes to make (before/after values, line numbers if known)
3. "Read each file before editing to verify exact content"

Use the fast model for mechanical renames; default model for changes requiring judgment.

## After subagents complete

Run verification searches (`rg`) to confirm all changes applied and no regressions introduced. If a subagent failed due to content mismatch, read the file and fix manually.
