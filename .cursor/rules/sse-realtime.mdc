# SSE / Real-Time Patterns

## Hub Architecture

`SSEHub` is a singleton created in `main.go`. Per-user channel sets with buffered channels (16). Non-blocking sends — if a client's buffer is full, the event is dropped (logged as warning). Max 5 connections per user prevents resource exhaustion.

```go
sseHub := service.NewSSEHub(cfg.SSETicketTTL)
// Pass to handler and any service that needs to push events
```

## Ticket Auth (not JWT in URL)

`EventSource` can't set `Authorization` headers. Never put JWTs in URLs (they leak into logs). Use one-time tickets:

1. Client calls `POST /api/v1/events/ticket` with JWT auth → gets a 30s single-use ticket
2. Client opens `EventSource("/api/v1/events/stream?ticket=<ticket>")`
3. Server validates and burns the ticket, begins streaming

The stream endpoint is on the public API group (not behind JWT middleware) — it uses ticket auth directly.

## Keepalive

Send `: keepalive\n\n` every 30 seconds. Cloud Run closes idle connections at 15 minutes.

## Frontend Reconnect

On disconnect: refresh access token first (it may have expired), request a new ticket, reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s → max 30s). Reset backoff on successful connect.

## Scaling Limitation

The hub is in-memory — all connected clients must be on the same instance. For multi-instance deployments, add a pub/sub layer (Redis, NATS). `Send()` and `Broadcast()` are the integration points.

## Adding New Event Types

Backend — publish from any service:

```go
sseHub.Send(userID, service.SSEEvent{
    Event: "order_updated",
    Data:  map[string]any{"order_id": orderID, "status": newStatus},
})
```

Frontend — register a typed handler:

```typescript
onSSEEvent<OrderUpdate>("order_updated", (data) => {
    toast.info(`Order ${data.order_id} is now ${data.status}`);
});
```

## Middleware

SSE endpoints must be excluded from gzip and timeout middleware (long-lived connections). Both are handled via path checks in `middleware/stack.go` for `/api/v1/events/stream`.
