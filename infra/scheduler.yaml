# Cloud Scheduler Jobs
# =============================================================================
# These jobs trigger HTTP endpoints on a schedule.
# Created via `gcloud scheduler jobs create http` in the deploy script.
#
# This file is a reference — not directly consumed by GCP.
# The deploy script reads these values to create/update the jobs.
#
# To add a new scheduled job:
#   1. Add the job definition below
#   2. Add a handler endpoint in the backend (protected by X-Scheduler-Secret)
#   3. Re-run the deploy script to provision the job
# =============================================================================

jobs:
  # Template — copy this block and replace the placeholders for each new job.
  # The handler endpoint must verify X-Scheduler-Secret before processing.
